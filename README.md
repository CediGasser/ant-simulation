# Ant Simulations!
This Project is currently being developed. It should evolve to be a website, with an interactive ant simulation. In addition there will be a documentation about ants and their adaptability, about the technical implementation and about the observations made on the simulation.

## Developing

Once you've clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/CediGasser/ant-simulation.git` and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Deployment

This repository is set up to automaticaly deploy any commits on the master branch to the server. So just code something that works, `git commit -am 'commit message'` and then `git push`.
